        - key_challenges: list of top 5 technical risks or challenges (short bullets)
        - suggested_stack: an object with frontend, backend, database, cache, messaging, ai_ml, infra (cloud provider), and recommended managed services or OSS components
        - architecture_overview: short textual system architecture description (components and data flow)
        - data_pipeline: how data will be collected, stored, and processed (batch/streaming), privacy considerations
        - infra_scaling: scaling strategy (stateless/services, autoscaling, CDNs, sharding)
        - security_and_privacy: main security controls and compliance flags
        - integrations: list of likely third-party integrations and why
        - prototype_plan: step-by-step 90-day MVP plan with milestones
        - timeline_estimate: object with phases and durations
        - cost_estimate: rough monthly cost bands (dev, staging, prod)
        - team_roles: list of required roles to build the first product
        - non_functional_requirements: latency, throughput, availability targets
        - feasibility: one of ["feasible","feasible_with_research","high_risk"]
        - confidence_score: integer 0-100 (confidence in the assessment)
